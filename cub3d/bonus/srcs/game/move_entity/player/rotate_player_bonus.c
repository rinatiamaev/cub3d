 * @brief Rotates the player's view direction and updates the view plane.
 *
 * This function updates the player's facing direction and camera view plane
 * after applying a rotation by the given angle. It uses trigonometric 
 * functions to compute the new direction and plane vectors.
 *
 * @details
 * - `facing_angle` stores the angle (in radians) the player is facing.
 * - `wrap_angle` ensures the angle remains within the valid 0 to 2Ï€ range.
 * - `facing_dir` is a normalized vector (x = cos(angle), y = sin(angle))
 *   that represents the player's direction.
 * - `view_plane` is perpendicular to `facing_dir`, scaled by FOV. It is 
 *   used in the raycasting algorithm to determine the visible field.
 *
 * @param player Pointer to the player structure.
 * @param angle_delta Angle to rotate (in radians). Positive is clockwise.
