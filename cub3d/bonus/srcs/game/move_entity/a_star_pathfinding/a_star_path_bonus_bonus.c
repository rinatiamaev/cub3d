 * @brief Reconstructs the path from the goal node to the start node.
 *
 * This function traces the parent pointers from the goal node back to
 * the start node to determine the full path. It first calculates the total
 * path length by walking through the linked list of parent nodes. Then it
 * allocates memory to store the path as an array of `t_dpoint`, representing
 * center-aligned positions (i.e., tile centers).
 *
 * The path is built in reverse order (from goal to start), so it is inserted
 * into the path array starting from the end. This ensures that the path
 * starts at the NPCâ€™s current position and ends at the goal.
 *
 * Any previously allocated path is freed before assigning a new one.
 *
 * @param game Pointer to the game context (used for memory allocation).
 * @param goal_node Pointer to the final node reached during pathfinding.
 * @param npc Pointer to the NPC for whom the path is reconstructed.

/**
 * @brief Executes the A* pathfinding algorithm from start to goal.
 *
 * This function performs the A* pathfinding algorithm to calculate an
 * optimal path from the start position to the goal position on a grid
 * for the given NPC. It initializes the A* data structures using
 * `setup_astar_struct`, and begins processing nodes.
 *
 * The algorithm maintains a min-heap (closed list) that prioritizes nodes
 * based on their total cost `f_cost = g_cost + h_cost`, where:
 * - g_cost: distance from start node
 * - h_cost: heuristic (Manhattan distance to goal)
 *
 * It extracts the node with the lowest f_cost, marks it as visited in the
 * open list, and checks if it has reached the goal. If the goal is reached,
 * it reconstructs the path and returns.
 *
 * If the goal is not yet reached, it expands the current node by calling
 * `spread_child_node`, which adds valid neighboring tiles to the heap.
 *
 * If no path is found, the NPC path is cleared and pathfinding ends.
 *
 * @param game Pointer to the game context.
 * @param npc The NPC that is pathfinding.
 * @param start The starting tile (grid coordinates).
 * @param goal The target tile (grid coordinates).
